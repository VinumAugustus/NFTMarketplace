# Marketplace for Non-fungible tokens 
Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are a highly nascent and emerging phenomenon revolutionizing how digital assets are traded. NFTs embody immutable rights to unique digital assets such as digital art and collectibles, and are represented as digital tokens that can be traded across marketplaces utilizing blockchain technologies. NFTs engender new ways to organize, consume, move, program, and store digital information, and have experienced a rapid rise in various adaptations across art, sport, broadcasting, content creation, and tech-crypto business.[[1]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0007681321002019?via%3Dihub)

The NFT file doesn’t contain the digital piece of art, or the video clip. It’s just a kind of contract, saying “the owner of this NFT owns this other digital file,” often with a link to the art file itself. NFTs could also be used as unforgeable digital tickets to events, or even ownership records for property sales — all they really are are one-of-a-kind bits of code with a verifiable chain of title attached.[[2]](https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2021-03-11/nft-explainer-crypto-trading-collectible)

This project using the ERC21 standard was developed based on the OpenZeppelin contract[[3]](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721)[[4]](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc721) and offers a marketplace that allows non-fungible tokens to be sold directly at a fixed price.
